# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install react-scripts`

This command installs React scripts, which are essential for bootstrapping a React application. You typically only need to run this once when setting up your project.

### `npm install antd`

Install Ant Design, a popular React UI library, to enhance your project's user interface.

### `npm install antd@latest`

If you want to ensure that you have the latest version of Ant Design, you can use this command to update it.

### `npm install antd @ant-design/icons`

Incorporate Ant Design icons to improve the visual appeal and functionality of your application.

### `npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-react`

This command installs Babel preset for React, allowing you to write JSX syntax and use modern React features.

### `npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-env`

Install Babel preset for environment-specific transpilation. It helps you ensure compatibility with different JavaScript environments.


### `npm run electron-dev`

Launch your Electron app in development mode. This command is typically used when you want to run your application as a desktop application.
